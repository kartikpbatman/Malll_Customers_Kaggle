# Mall Customer Clustering

This project is my attempt at exploring customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Part of my self-learning journey in data science. I wanted to figure out how unsupervised learning works and how clusters can show patterns in customer behaviour.

## What I worked on

- Plotted relationships between features like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score
- Used the Elbow Method to figure out the best number of clusters
- Understood how WCSS shows how tight clusters are
- Learnt how `k-means++` helps pick better starting centroids so theyâ€™re not too close
- Trained the KMeans model and plotted the clusters
- Checked the cluster centres to understand customer groups
---
## What I learnt

- How K-Means clustering works step by step
- Why choosing good centroids matters
- How randomness affects clustering and how to control it
- How to visualize clusters and interpret the results
